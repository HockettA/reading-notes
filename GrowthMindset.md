# What is a Growth Mindset?
I am a firm believer that it is not the amount of brains that you bring to the table, but how you use them! While we all have an innate set of skills and level of intelligence that we are bestoyed at birth, this can only get you so far. Without a drive to seek additional knowledge and skills, a person is in a fixed state of learning and growth. It is through adoption of a growth mindset that one can continue to expand their intelligence. According to Haffenden (2015), there are some common areas that can help a person strive toward continued growth. 

 * Ensuring that one embraces challenges rather than backs away when it becomes difficult to catch on to a new skill.
 * Similarly, it's essential to move through the pits or roadblocks.
 * Put the effort in to get the outcome you are seeking even when it gets difficult.
 * Embrace critism or critique from others to learn potential ways to improve your process.
 * Likewise, do not envy others who are catching on or who are achieving, but learn from them!   

  **Reminders to stay in the growth mindset...**
  1. Don't take criticism as negative, but a mechanism in which growth may be facilitated. There is always room for improvement. ðŸ¤ 
  2. Anything worth learning will take time to master. Practice will be key to mastery!
  3. Dedicate time, even if it is small chunks of time to focus on learning a new skill.
