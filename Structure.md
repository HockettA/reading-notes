# Mock Up to Mark Up!
When beginning a new web development project there are some key steps to consider:

1. **Map out the project goal**
    * What is the intent of the website?
    * Who is the audience?
    * What technology devices will need to be considered in the build?

2. **Do your research**
    * Build user personas
    * Investigate industry standards and best practices
    * Document findings and important details for future reference

3. **Map the user flow**
    * Identify how the customer might need to interact with the webpage
    * Map the process for efficient interaction

4. **Create a Simple Wireframe**
    * Use the research done to create a rough sketch to arrange the elements (keep it simple)
    * Sketch in whatever way makes sense either through paper and pencil or using a web program such as draw.o
    * Identify the important pieces to have at the forefront of your page
    * Consider how arrangement of each element might add to or detract from efficient use of the website
    * Draft a couple possibilities and consult with others on the basic wireframe

5. **Add HTML Skeleton**
    * Transform the sketched wireframe to basic code elements and placement
    * Test and adjust as needed
    * Add details for making the HTML layout

6. **Test and Gain Feedback from Users**


**LAUNCH!!!**
