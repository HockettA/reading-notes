# Mock Up to Mark Up!
When beginning a new web development project there are some key steps to consider:

1. **Map out the project goal**
    * What is the intent of the website?
    * Who is the audience?
    * What technology devices will need to be considered in the build?

2. **Do your research**
    * Build user personas
    * Investigate industry standards and best practices
    * Document findings and important details for future reference

3. **Map the user flow**
    * Identify how the customer might need to interact with the webpage
    * Map the process for efficient interaction

4. **Create a Simple Wireframe**
    * Use the research done to create a rough sketch to arrange the elements (keep it simple)
    * Sketch in whatever way makes sense either through paper and pencil or using a web program such as draw.o
    * Identify the important pieces to have at the forefront of your page
    * Consider how arrangement of each element might add to or detract from efficient use of the website
    * Draft a couple possibilities and consult with others on the basic wireframe

5. **Add HTML Skeleton**
    * Transform the sketched wireframe to basic code elements and placement
    * Test and adjust as needed
    * Add details for making the HTML layout

6. **Test and Gain Feedback from Users**

# Basic Anatomy of HTML
HTML is short for **H**yper **T**ext **L**anguage; it is what defines the structure of the content on a website. Code is comprised on a series of elements housed within a basic structure of head, body, main, and footer. An element includes three components an opening tag, content(information you want to share), and closing tag. Below is the basic starting structure of HTML code.

!DOCTYPE html: This lets the browser know what type of file it is reading

html: Opens the html code
    
    head: This section provides instructions for the browser. This is not seen on a website.
        meta: tag to describe the data about the data, formally used to help the search engine pull up relevant websites when an individual inputs a search criteria.
        title: This is what shows on the browser tab when opened
    
      
    body: This begins the section composed of the primary content of the website.


    <img src ="http://placehold.it/300x200"/> : image tag 
        <h1>: Header tag. HTML has six header levels possible
        <p>: Makes a block of text a separate paragraph
        <ul>: This is an unordered list, meant for lists where items do not have an order of importance
        <ol>: This is an ordered list, where order is important
        <a>: anchor tag for inputting links <a href = "https://link.html">
    </body>
    <footer> : Added content for the bottom of a page
    </footer>: Closes the footer tag

# Semantics #

Semantics refers to the meaning a particular code has on the text it is associated. For instance <h1>Hello World!</h1> states that "Hello World" will be treated as a primary header and will abide by the rules associated including being large print, underlined, and bolded.
