# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a free web-based platform that enables coders to share their code publicly and possibly get feeback from others on potential improvements. In depth knowledge of coding is not needed to start using GitHub. However, a profile is needed to start experimenting! In addition to providing a place for coders or developers to network through shared code, it also enables teams of developers to collaborate on projects together through what is called repositories. Repositories are devoted to a specific project that contains related project files such as HTML code, images, and markdown(.md) files. It also has a built-in version control mechansism called a "commit " that allows a team working on a project to see what changes have been made to a specific project and why.


## What is Markdown? ##
Markdown files are unique to GitHub; the files themselves contain text. However, the text is styled in GitHub's markdown files by utilizing markdown syntax. The syntax is fairly easy to use to organize and add emphasis to text on a page including inclusion of headers, application of bolding or italics to specific words, or adding images and lists.
