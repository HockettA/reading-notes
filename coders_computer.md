# Learning - The Coder's Computer
This class provided some important foundational information that helps a prospective developer understand the different tools available to ensure success in managing future projects. This week we learned about command line interface and terminal, the different types of text editors, and walked through the steps for preparing the computer for code development. 

## Command Line Interface and Terminal
Command line, also referred to as a terminal is a way to work with your computer system through input of text commands. Once a command is entered by the user, the command is processed and returns a result.

## Text Editors
A text editor is exactly what it sounds like; it is an application or software that is downloaded on your computer or accessed via the internet that allows you to work with text. However, there are different types of text editors that allows you to work with text in different ways. The most simplistic application that you might be familiar with is Notepad for Windows or Text Edit for Mac users. These come with very little bells and whistles only allowing only simple storage of whatever text you choose to write. However, if you are developing code you might need something a little more advanced to help write and manage the text associated with complex projects in an efficient manner. Like spell check in Microsoft Word is beneficial when writing text for a report, a coding specific text editor has some key features to help the developer check for errors in code, organize information, and work more efficiently. 

**Some key features of a good coding specific text editor includes:**  

Important Features | Description
------------------ | -----------
Code Completion | Provides suggested values based on what the users inputs. It may also provide closing tags or brackets if the user inputs the opening tag or bracket.This helps the user save time when writing code.
Highlights Syntax | In code there are different command types or associated syntax for writing. This feature colors the different syntax types to help the developer recognize potential errors in the code.
Selection of Themes | A developer spends a lot of time starring at the computer. This feature allows the developer to select a background that reduces eye strain as much as possible.
Additional Extensions| Extensions add new capability to what the developer can do. They are basically plug-ins, each with a unique role such as debugging your code for errors or providing a quick start for a new HTML file.  

## Programs installed
During the second class, focus was placed on building the environment on the computer that will enable efficient coding development. This included setting up multiple tools and programs to configure the terminal environment for development and establish a folder structure for storing code. In addition, we established a local connection to GitHub and installed the text editor that will be used to write and manage text when building a website.
