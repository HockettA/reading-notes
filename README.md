## What is a Growth Mindset?

  **Reminders to stay in the growth mindset...**
  1. Dont' take criticism as negative, but a mechanism in which growth may be facilitated. There is always room for improvement. ðŸ¤ 
  2. Anything worth learning will take time to master. Practice will be key to mastery!
  3. Dedicate time, even if it is small chunks of time to focus on learning a new skill.
