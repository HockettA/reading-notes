# About Me

Hi my name is Amy Hockett, I am an ***Epidemiologist*** with a desire to continue learning new skills! I currently have a PhD in Public Health - Epidemiology, Masters in Public Health - Community Health, and a Bachelors of Science in Human Biology. Throughout the pandemic and 2020 Derecho I became inspired to learn new skills that would help me do my job more efficiently and effectively. I am excited to dive deeper into the world of coding.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending my time with my amazing wife, **Annie** and two dogs, Hopper and Henry. I also have a passion for travel, exploring new cultures, and cooking. I practice a primarily plant-based diet, so it is always a fun challenge to find unique recipes and restaurant options that support a cleaner diet.
